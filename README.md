# 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️ Mini_Shell_42 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
## Overview
This project is part of the 42 Network curriculum. The goal of Minishell is to create a simplified version of a Unix shell. You will implement essential shell functionalities such as command execution, redirections, pipes, signal handling, and built-in shell commands, providing a deeper understanding of how shells like Bash work.

Minishell is a collaborative project that introduces you to system calls, process management, file descriptors, and various aspects of how a shell functions.
