# Mini_Shell_42
This project is part of the 42 Network curriculum. The goal of Minishell is to create a simplified version of a Unix shell. You will implement essential shell functionalities such as command execution, redirections, pipes, signal handling, and built-in shell commands, providing a deeper understanding of how shells like Bash work.
